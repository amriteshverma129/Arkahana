    <h1>Welcome to the Glitch Eleventy starter, where you can create a<br/> blog or landing page that generates <br/>a static
        site.</h1>

    <h4>Each of the initial blog posts has special tips to help you get the most out of your new site–work through them<br/>
        all, learning how to add posts and customize how your site builds along the way. Once you've mastered the<br/>
        basics, you can delete all these posts and continue writing your own!</h4>
